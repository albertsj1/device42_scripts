# Scripts I've written to be used with [Device42][1]

## device42_linux_inv.sh

This script is written completely in bash and has been tested to work on RHEL/CentOS 4,5 & 6.
You'll want to edit the section near the top for user, pass, etc.  There is also a section at the end that I use for setting custom key/value pair for each device.  You'll want to comment this section out or change the file name to something that works for you.  The file is expected to be in the format: 'key:value' for each line.
